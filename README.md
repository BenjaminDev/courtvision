# Welcome to CourtVision
A library and simple application aims to extract useful infromation from videos of court-based[^1] sports. By detecting and tracking players as well as the ball CourtVision captures data at 30 frames per second. By visualizing this high resolution data it is hoped players and coaches will find interesting take-a-ways.

This project in only starting.




[^1]: Currently only padel is supported.
